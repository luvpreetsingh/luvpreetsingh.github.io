I am a Software Engineer at [Vogo Rentals](http://www.vogo.in/index.html). I work to make simple and interactive monitoring systems which make debugging easier and faster. I did my graduation from [GNDU, Amritsar](http://web.gndu.ac.in/) in 2017.

I have worked in System Monitoring and Log Analysis. Currently, I am working on automation tools for CI and Deployment. I have profound experience of working in Python and Django as well. Here is my [LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/luvpreet-singh-a66112126/).

I am deeply interested in studying Operating Systems. I have just started working in this field and I am looking for opportunities to learn more and open for them.
