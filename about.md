I am a Software Engineer at [Vogo Rentals](http://www.vogo.in/index.html). I did my graduation from [GNDU, Amritsar](http://web.gndu.ac.in/), class of 2017. This is the website where I sometimes write about the challenges I face in my daily work. Here is my [LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/luvpreet-singh-a66112126/).

I am deeply interested in studying Operating Systems and Networking. I have just started working in this field and I am very interested in learning and exploring new stuff.
